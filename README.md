# Pnda

**This project is a work in progress...**

The programming language. 

This came about as a project of interest. After programming with Python, Javascript, and C/C++ I've developed a liking for certain features of different languages. Panda is meant to be a programming language that incoporates the features I enjoy from all the different languages I've come across.

Panda is written in C++ and uses the [Crafting Interpreter's](https://craftingintepreters.com) guide for writing the intepreter. 

# Features

- Garbage collected
- Dynamically typed

Look at the [Pndoc][/doc/pndoc.md] to look into syntax and structure.
